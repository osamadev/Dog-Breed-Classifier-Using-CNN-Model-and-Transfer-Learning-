##	Dog Breed Classifier using CNN and Transfer Learning

This project is about building a dog breed classifier using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Transfer Learning. The test accuracy of this CNN model to predict the dog breeds from its images is about 87%. In the final model using transfer learning, I have used Xception pre-trained model to act as a features extractor of the dogsâ€™ dataset, and then apply fully connected dense layers to classify the dog images into its predicted breed. Finally I converted the final model into Flask Web App to be production-ready solution. The dataset has a limited number of instances, so to protect against overfitting and augment the size of training dataset; we used data augmentation technique to increase the number of the instances in the training dataset as well as the validation dataset.
